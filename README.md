## Usage

With some basic knowledge you could easily customize for your own needs.
The CSS (found in `App.css`) provides a somewhat solid foundation that you can further tweak for personalization.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Utilizes media queries and a flexible grid layout to ensure the site looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. The navbar collapses into a burger menu on smaller screens.

- **Smooth Animations:**  
  CSS transitions and keyframe animations (e.g., `fadeInFooter`) create engaging visual effects without compromising performance.

- **Interactive Elements:**  
  Project cards and hero slides include hover effects and scaling transformations for a dynamic user experience.

- **Optimized Image Rendering:**  
  The hero and project images use `object-fit: cover` to maintain visual quality across different screen sizes and aspect ratios.

- **Clean, Modular Code:**  
  The separation of components and CSS styling encourages maintainability and scalability, making future enhancements straightforward.
